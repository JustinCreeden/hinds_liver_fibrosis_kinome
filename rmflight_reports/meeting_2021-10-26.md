TODO:

* Pathway enrichment on differential results
  * with KEA3 things that show up too
  * Maybe do network based on a signalling pathway?
* KEA3 network based on differential gene list, see what comes up?
* Want the KEA3 network nodes with the fold-changes from mouse and human in a table
* Scaling those fold-changes so they are comparable between figures

DONE:

* Modify the heatmap to get rid of sample labels and add color on other side, see Hinds powerpoint that was sent
* Pathway enrichment report sent.
* KEA3 network nodes with fold-changes.
