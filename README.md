This code and data repository is in support of the manuscript:

Hepatic Kinome Atlas: An In-Depth Identification of Kinase Pathways in Liver Fibrosis of Humans and Rodents 
Creeden et al., 2021

## Directory Structure

```

/data: all data used and generated outside of Human Protein Atlas data

  /inputs: data used as input to analyses

    /kea3: kea3 GMT files downloaded from their web-portal
      *.gmt each file was generated by KEA3 to define the genes targeted by each kinase

    /pamgene_near_raw: the PamGene near raw data
      *. ...
      
    /hpa: directory for the hpa data (see below)

    /differential_reports: I think the various outputs should go here
      *.
      
  /outputs: stuff that was generated by other scripts
    
    These include:
      ... rds files from below scripts
      ... pptx files from below scripts
      ... excel files from below scripts
  
/reports: Rmarkdown reports that generate results
  
  describe each report, or add more text to each one ...
  
  
/scripts

  functions.R: various functions used in other places
  
  pull_kegg_pathways.R: script to get KEGG pathway data
  
  create_go_annotations.R: create the various gene annotations used elsewhere
  
  get_kegg_data.R: pull the gene-KEGG pathway data
  
  create_kea3_network.R: create the initial KEA3 network from downloaded data
  
  run_all.R: script to regenerate all of the results and reports    
  
/renv.lock: json formatted file recording the packages installed for this analysis and their versions. Generated from `renv::snapshot()`.
```


## HPA Data

The HPA data should be downloaded from https://www.proteinatlas.org/download/rna_tissue_consensus.tsv.zip, on the page https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download.

The zip file should be moved to 

## R Packages Used

The full list of R packages used in the analysis is encoded in `renv.lock`.
This was generated from the `renv::snapshot()` function.
To install the packages on a new platform, you should use `renv::restore()`.


## Regeneration of Results

To rerun **all** of the analyses described in the manuscript, you should be able to open
an R terminal or Rstudio and do:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::activate()
renv::restore()
source("scripts/run_all.R")
```

You may have to make sure you are running the R 4.1.* version first, as all primary results were generated using that R version.
